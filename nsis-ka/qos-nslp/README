README for the QoS NSLP KA implementation
=========================================
this component depends on

ntlp
protlib
qspec

You need to check-out 
https://svn.tm.kit.edu/nsis/dist/qos-nslp-ka/trunk
in order to get all the required components automatically.
Use 
./configure
make
make install
to configure, compile and install the software.

See src/client.cpp for an example how to use the
QoS NSLP for requesting QoS reservations. The 
QoS_NSLP_Client_API can be used within your application
as indicated. It will communicate with the QoS NSLP 
daemon process via Unix Domain Sockets.

Please change the file 
../nsis-ka.conf as required, e.g.,
you must specify the IP addresses of your machine
in the [gist] configuration part.

Start the QoS NSLP daemon using the start script
src/start-qosnslp
as superuser (e.g., cd src; sudo ./start-qosnslp)
(this will also create some soft-links to scripts
in the ntlp directory)

Start the client as
sudo ./client <src-ip> <dst-ip>
