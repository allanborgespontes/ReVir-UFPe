Test Suite for Protlib
----------------------

This directory contains a test suite for Protlib. New tests can simply be
placed into this directory (see test_template.cpp for an example).
The Makefile will build and run them automatically together with the existing
tests if you type
make check

Sometimes the loopback tests for IPv4 or IPv6 may fail, 
re-running them is often successful though.

Enable log output during testing by setting the TEST_LOG environment variable:
export TEST_LOG=true
Output will go into file testoutput.log in this directory.

All tests use the cppunit testing framework (http://cppunit.sf.net), a C++
implementation of the popular junit package. Cppunit is available as a
Debian/Ubuntu package (libcppunit-dev), or via

	https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11795
