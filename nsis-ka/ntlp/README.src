GISTka v%GIST_RELEASE% - README
###########################################
Welcome to this README on the GIST implementation
of the Institute of Telematics, University of Karlsruhe (TH).
 
This version is largely conforming to
the protocol specification to draft-ietf-nsis-ntlp-29.txt
(see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nsis-ntlp-20)

This implementation can be used in 2 ways:

- as a library against which your program will link (as an example of how to
  do this, please look at our QoS-NSLP implementation, which uses GISTka as
  a library)

- as a standalone instance providing the Unix Domain Socket API as defined by
  the NSIS-Suite of the University of GÃ¶ttingen.
  The standalone instance comes with a small testing interface 
  (GISTConsole) that can be enabled using --echo <nslpid> and
  reached via telnet localhost 40023

More Information:
=================
Please visit our TRAC site at

https://nsis-ka.org/
or
https://i72svn.tm.kit.edu/trac/NSIS

as it will show the latest releases and also
contains additional documentation as well as 
a bug tracker.

Notes on building:
==================
- Unfortunately we have no configure or automake support yet.

- The code was tested to build on 
  SuSE Linux 9.2, 9.3, 10.0-10.2, Ubuntu 8.10,8.04,7.10,7.04,6.06, Fedora 6 
  using GCC 3.3.5 as well as GCC 4.0, 4.1, 4.2

- To build the program/library, be sure to have the following libraries installed:
  
  x libIPQ (in some Linux distributions, part of "iptables-devel")
  x OpenSSL 0.97e or higher
  x ProtLib library of the Institute of Telematics
    (already included if you checked GIST out of our SVN. 
    Extract to "protlib" directory on the same level as "src" and "include"
    otherwise )

  If you want to use GIST with SCTP as transport protocol, you need the 
  development files (e.g. libsctp-dev package under Ubuntu). 
  Use 
  make SCTP_KERN=1 
  to build GISTka with SCTP support.

- Type "make" to build Protlib, GIST Standalone instance and libGist.
  If you get errors for ipv6 socket functions like inet6_opt_init()
  probably don't have a newer glibc with advanced IPv6 API support 
  according to RFC3542.
  Try 
  make USE_RFC2292=1
  to compile it with the obsolete RFC interface.

Notes on execution:
===================
- The "gist" wrapper script will start the standalone instance
- The "loadmodules" script will load IPQueue kernel module
- The "intercept" script will set up iptables rules for packet interception
- The "flush" script unsets these rules
- The standalone instance as well as any program using the GIST library must
  be run as "root"
The GIST standalone instance will call "intercept" automatically.

You could now connect to the running GIST instance by typing 
telnet localhost 40023
on the same machine. You can shutdown the running instance
using the command "shutdown". 
Please look further details up in 
testing/README.TESTING

Note: If iptables rules are in place, UDP packets are intercepted (usually
only for the specific GIST well-known port). Better always clean up the rules 
via "flush" after program execution in order to avoid capturing other UDP
packets ("gist" wrapper script does so automatically).

TLS use:
=======
You must create certificates first. Please look into the
"scripts/" subdirectory. The following default names are used:
client_cert.pem    (Client certificate -> used for validating a connecting client)
client_privkey.pem (Client private key -> must be transferred to client connecting to us)
root_cert.pem      (CA certificate)


This program was initially written by Thomas Herzog as part of 
his diploma thesis. If you have got questions or bug reports,
