Scripts for TLS
---------------
simply create a CA:
./mkca
create a certificate for every IP address of the 
connecting clients:
./mkcert 10.0.0.1

Then copy the 10.0.0.1_cert.pem to client_cert.pem
and 10.0.0.1_privkey.pem to client_privkey.pem.
The certificates (client_cert.pem, root_cert.pem) 
must be put into the directory
where the gist script is located. 
The client_privkey.pem must be transferred to the client connecting 
to us.

The implementation uses the following names as default:
"client_cert.pem" for the client certificate
"client_privkey.pem" for the client private key
"root_cert.pem" for the CAs certificate
