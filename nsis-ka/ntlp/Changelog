gist-ka-0.97 (rxxxx):
=====================
	- upgrade to draft -20: now using C-Flag in common header to 
	  indicate Query encapsulation (was introduced in draft -17)
	- Invalid C Flag error handling
	- added check for reception of own Query, there will be a warning and it will be ignored
	- added additional consistency check for stack configuration data and stack profile
	- modified tp_queryencap to also intercept packets that have no RAO set, if the new option 
	  intercept-requires-rao==false
	- tp_queryencap will check for the C-Flag if intercept-requires-rao==false
	  (otherwise normal Confirm and Data Packets in C-mode will be captured by
	  tp_queryencap, too)
	- use of configpar class for configuration parameters:
	  consistent naming of parameters at command line, config file, 
	  and interactive console
	- included mobility enhancements by Max Laier (Flow Info Service),
	  this will only be compiled if you have a corresponding MIP6d installed
	- improved GISTConsole to set all available GIST parameters
	- implemented NAT traversal (early stage)
	- improved responder cookie mechanism to carry transparent data, too
	- cleaned up code for setting the RAO (Micha Lenk)
	- routingentry is now a full class
	- several smaller bug fixes
	

gist-ka-0.96 (r2957):
=====================
	- fix state setup for MA re-use: state was not set up in C-mode
	  if stack config was missing. Now MA re-use will automatically
	  set state to C-mode.
	- improved ovi_object handling in ntlp_errorobject: 
	  in case of parse errors ovi_object now contains a raw_ntlp_object
	- merge with ntlp/branches/sii-handle-fix r2954:
	  this will allow for SII handle re-use for same peers
	  and thus fix ticket #4
	- fixed MA re-use behavior on querier side:
	  if responder sent response via MA, routing state was not promoted
	  to C-mode and confirm was not sent via MA. Fixed now.
        - added explicit signaling target MRM (merge done in r2949)
	- cancel any running timers if routing state gets deleted by
	  to_inactive_qnode
	- added test cases for errorobject

gist-ka-0.95.2 (r2918):
=======================
	- fixed setup of C-mode if MA re-use
	  and Confirm did not contain Stack Configuration data

gist-ka-0.95.1 (r2906):
=======================
	- improved behavior according to Postel
	  principle: 
	  * now we do not always send a responder cookie
	    unless required
	  * we do not require a responder cookie in
	    a Confirm unless required.
	- verify responder cookie always if present
	- echo the incoming interface in the responder
	  cookie (as required by draft-14)
	- fixed DEBUG_TP config parameter interpretation
	- improved error handling and fixed in the errorobject
