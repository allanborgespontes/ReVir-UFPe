some ideas for test cases:

- Sending non-Data message with E-flag:
  *  must be a DATA message, any other message with an E-flag set
     must cause: Common Header Parse Error, Invalid E flag
- check for invalid use of R flag:
  The rules governing the use of the R-flag depend on the GIST message
   type.  It MUST always be set (R=1) in Query messages, since these
   always elicit a Response, and never in Confirm, Data or Error
   messages.  It MAY be set in an MA-Hello; if set, another MA-Hello
   MUST be sent in reply.  It MAY be set in a Response, but MUST be set
   if the Response contains a Responder cookie; if set, a Confirm MUST
   be sent in reply.
