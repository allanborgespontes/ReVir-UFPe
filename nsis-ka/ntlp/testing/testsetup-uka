Test setup for test "chain of 3 routers"
########################################


IPv4:

tb1 eth1 <-> tb2 eth2
tb2 eth1 <-> tb3 eth1

tb1 eth1: 10.10.1.1 / 255.255.255.0
tb2 eth2: 10.10.1.2 / 255.255.255.0
tb2 eth1: 10.10.2.2 / 255.255.255.0
tb3 eth2: 10.10.2.3 / 255.255.255.0


IP-Forwarding enabled on tb2, static route for 10.10.2.x from tb1 via eth1 (to
tb2). Backwards from tb3 to 10.10.1.x via eth2 (to tb2).

Note: In general, the backwards route from tb3 to tb1 is NOT necessary because GIST in general
initiates the connection FORWARDS.

Thus it should be possible to establish a chain of 3 interconnected GISTs via
initiating the connect from tb1 (10.10.1.1) to tb3 (10.10.2.3).

The communication after the initial path setup will then run via their normal links (eth0) because
these are the addresses in the router's DNS entries.

Do not forget to set up netfilter kernel modules on the hosts via the script "loadmodules"
prior to starting your GIST instance.

Afterwards, you should enable Packet filtering by "intercept"

The script "flush" will reset the netfilter rules when you are
finished testing.

Please keep in mind: Use the address of tb3 from tb1 and the message will only
reach tb2, which will intercept it. This is the correct design, if a matching NSLP is
registered on this host.
