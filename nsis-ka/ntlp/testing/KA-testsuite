What should be tested:
Two nodes a and b directly connected.
- Setup session A in D-Mode a->b
- Promotion of session A to C-Mode insecure a->b
- Promotion of session A to C-Mode secure a->b
- Sending of data unsecure/unreliable (should use TLS MA) a->b
- Sending of data unsecure/reliable (should use TLS MA) a->b
- Other side sets up session b->a: Setup of session B from 
  responder side should then lead to re-use
  of TLS MA as well (is this ok due to SPEC?). This is the strange
  case where Responder has no control over the MA.
- if no data is sent:
  - MA should go to IDLE and should be torn down after a timeout
  - Message routing state should tome out after a while
