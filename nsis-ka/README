README: dist
------------
This is the NSIS-ka suite from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
Home of the source code is here: http://nsis-ka.org/
or if this doesn't work, try https://svn.tm.kit.edu/trac/NSIS

The NSIS protocol suite is defined by the following documents:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5971 (GIST)
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5973 (NAT/Firewall Signaling)
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5974 (Quality-of-Service Signaling)
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5975 (QSPEC Template)
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5981 (Session Authorization Object) (optional)

This is a distribution directory for all NSIS-ka components.  

Currently these are:

 Name		| Dependencies		| Base location | RFC
----------------+-----------------------+----------------------------
 protlib	| none			| PROTLIB_DIR   | n/a
		|			| FQUEUE_DIR    | n/a
 ntlp		| protlib		| NTLP_DIR      | rfc5971
 natfw-nslp	| protlib, ntlp		| NATFW_DIR     | rfc5973
 qos-nslp	| protlib, ntlp, qspec, | QOSNSLP_DIR   | rfc5974
                | sessionauth	        |               |
 qspec		| protlib		| QSPEC_DIR     | rfc5975
 sessionauth    | protlib, qos-nslp     | AUTH_DIR      | rfc5981

Each single component is contained in an own directory and 
knows its dependencies and will include and build  them as required. 

HOW TO COMPILE
--------------
This suite uses the autotools (automake, configure)
suite. If you've got the source code with a "configure" file,
simply run

./configure
make
make install

If the configure file is missing, you can create one if you
have autotools installed (e.g., apt-get install automake autoconf)
then simply run
make -f Makefile.svn
(which should run the command autoreconf --install for you)

Due to the silent-rules option we require automake 1.11,
you may use earlier versions if deleting these statements
at the beginning of configure.ac files. Silent build is
on by default, to see full make output use 
make V=1


OPTIONS
-------
You can pass the following options to configure:

(Protlib)
  --disable-debug         disable debug code (default: debugging enabled)
  --disable-logging       disable logging output (default: logging enabled)
  --enable-sctp           compile with SCTP support (default: SCTP disabled)
(GIST)
  --use-flowinfo          use flowinfo module for mobility support (default:
                          disabled)


PROBLEMS?
---------
In case of any problems, please check for any open/closed tickets
in our TRAC or try the latest trunk code from the svn:
svn co https://svn.tm.kit.edu/nsis/dist/nsis-ka/trunk/

DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION
----------------------
In order to find the sources the respective Makefiles take input from
``Makefile.inc'' which defines all required locations.

All locations are relative to DISTDIR.  This allows to build individual
components ``free-standing'' to support branch building without the
need to branch dist, maintain local ``svn:externals'' or ``svn
switch''ed working copies.  Instead one can checkout a base dist and
build a branch against this base by setting DISTDIR accordingly.
tools/mkbranch is a script that tries to do that automatically.

Further more individual components can be used from different locations
by setting the respective base location.

tools/tag-release is a tiny shell script that helps with release
tagging.  Given a name for the release it will produce a couple of svn
commands to copy the selected svn:externals into a tag-directory under
the dist hierarchy.
